Create a structure called 'Employee' with members, Emp name, Emp no, Basic Pay and Total Salary. Read the values for data members of 'n' employees in main function and compute Total Salary of each employee in a separate function. Use pointer to structure concept.
Consider DA as 40% of basic pay, HRA is 15% of basic pay. Total = DA + HRA + basic.

    product ID (integer)
    name (string)
    category (string)
    price (float)
    quantity in stock (integer)
Additionally, write the necessary functions to:     Input product information from the user.    Display the details of each product.     Sort the product records by both category and price in ascending order (first by category, then by price within each category).
